# Script_Formatter
The goal of this project was to create a simple, easy to use, appealing, and affordable Google Docs Add-on that helps the user to write professional, formatted film industry-standard scripts.

#Components
* **Scene Headings**
  * The scene heading is there to help break up physical spaces and give the reader and production team an idea of the storyâ€™s geography.

    You will either choose *INT.* for interior spaces or *EXT.* for exterior spaces. Then a *description of the setting*, and then the *time of day*.

* **Actions**
  * Action lines are where you describe the visual and audible actions that take place on screen. You want to write in third person in present tense.

* **Characters**
  * Character lines are where you identify who is talking.

* **Dialogue**
  * Dialogue lines are fitted underneath CHARACTER and are the actual lines of speech your character says.

# Additional Features
The component buttons located in the sidebar of the tool offer definitions of each component when hovered over in case the user forgets or is unsure of each component's purpose within a script.

# Ongoing Maintenance
Short term: I'm currently working to automatically center certain components whenever formatting selected text as well as break apart the text to a new line.

Long term: I would like to add further useful buttons like SCENE NUMBER, SHOT, and TRANSITIONS.
